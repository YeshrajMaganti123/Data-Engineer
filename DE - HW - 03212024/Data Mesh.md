Data Mesh Principles: A New Approach to Data Management
Data Mesh is a paradigm shift in how organizations handle and use data. It shifts from centralized data lakes and warehouses to a more dispersed, domain-driven methodology. The four fundamental ideas that underpin Data Mesh are as follows:
1.	Domain-Driven Decentralized Data Ownership: This principle highlights that the business domain that creates the data bears ownership and responsibility for it. Within these areas, data teams are responsible for the delivery, quality, and integrity of their data products. This allows domain specialists to have the greatest understanding of their data and promotes a sense of ownership.
2.	Data as a Product: Data evolves into a well-defined, self-contained entity with a clear function, just like any other product. Data producers handle their data like a product, making sure that customers (other teams within the company) can find, comprehend, and trust it. This facilitates consumption and encourages data uniformity.
3.	Self-Serve Data Infrastructure: For data producers and users, the architecture offers a self-service platform. Tools and resources for data processing, transformation, and access are provided by this platform. Picture a data app shop, where domains could list their data products and users could find and use them with ease.
4.	Federated Computational Governance: Even when ownership of data is distributed, governance is still essential. Throughout the whole mesh, this principle creates a set of guidelines and standards for data security, privacy, and quality. Additionally, it guarantees data product compatibility, facilitating easy integration and analysis.
5.	Data Mesh Architecture: Breaking Down Silos
Data Mesh translates complex data management into a building-block approach.
•	Business domains (finance, marketing, etc.) act as the foundation, each owning and managing their data.
•	These domains create well-defined data products (reports, datasets, etc.) for others to use.
•	A self-service platform allows easy discovery and access to these data products, like an app store for data.
•	Governance rules ensure consistent data quality and security across the entire system.
